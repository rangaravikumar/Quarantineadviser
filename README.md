Currently I integrated IBM Watson assistant with Facebook Messanger and HTML Web App

For HTML web app integration ,I did not use any server side application, directly integrated IBM Watson assistant chat bot service preview link through Iframe because I have IBM Cloud Lite plan only, its limited upto 256 MB Only. In future, I will create server side application using Node.JS
